The 2019 - 2020 NBA season will be kicking off today October 22nd with the Los Angles Lakers vs the Los Angles Clippers at 10:00pm EST and the New Orleans Pelicans vs the Toronto Raptors at 7:30 EST. All NBA fans are bursting with excitment for this season as for the first time in years we don't have a clear cut winner. The Golden State Warriors were an all time team in 2016 (broke the NBA record for most wins with a record of 73-9) but were ultimately dismanteled by Lebron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2016. They then added Kevin Durant in 2017 and were unstoppable until recently when they lost the 2019 championship to the Toronto Raptors. However, the warriors aren't the same team they once were anymore, and with many teams adding star players to their roster, it's going to be a dog fight for the championship this year. 

## Los Angles Lakers
The Los Angles Lakers have a lot of things going for them ever since they pulled the block buster trade making Anthony Davis a laker. One of them being, they're one of the favorites to win it all this year. With many teams scoring big in free agency, the Lakers also did their fair share; adding guys such as Danny Green, Dwight Howard, Avery Bradely, and Quinn Cook while retaining some of the guys from last year.

**Pros**
* Lebron & Anthony Davis pairing
* Kyle Kuzma comming off the bench
* Play Big
* Danny Green
* Lots of shooting
* Great Spacing

**Cons**
* Minimal Depth
* Lebron being 34 going on 35
