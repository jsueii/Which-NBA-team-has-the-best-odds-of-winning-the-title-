The 2019 - 2020 NBA season will be kicking off today October 22nd with the Los Angles Lakers vs the Los Angles Clippers at 10:00pm EST and the New Orleans Pelicans vs the Toronto Raptors at 7:30 EST. All NBA fans are bursting with excitment for this season as for the first time in years we don't have a clear cut winner. The Golden State Warriors were an all time team in 2016 (broke the NBA record for most wins with a record of 73-9) but were ultimately dismanteled by Lebron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2016. They then added Kevin Durant in 2017 and were unstoppable until recently when they lost the 2019 championship to the Toronto Raptors. However, the warriors aren't the same team they once were anymore, and with many teams adding star players to their roster, it's going to be a dog fight for the championship this year. 

## Los Angles Lakers
The Los Angles Lakers have a lot of things going for them ever since they pulled the block buster trade making Anthony Davis a laker. One of them being, they're one of the favorites to win it all this year. With many teams scoring big in free agency, the Lakers also did their fair share; adding guys such as Danny Green, Dwight Howard, Avery Bradely, and Quinn Cook while retaining some of the guys from last year.

**Pros**
* Kyle Kuzma comming off the bench
* Play Big
* Defense
* Lots of shooting
* Great Spacing

**Cons**
* Minimal Depth
* Lebron being 34 going on 35

## Los Angles Clippers
The Los Angles Clippers became instant title contenders when they signed both Paul George and Kawhi Leonard. They are currently the favorites to win the Championship, however that doesn't mean they're untouchable.

**Pros**
* Depth
* Defense 
* Shooters
* Loaded with talent

**Cons**
* Paul George and the concers around his injury

## Golden State Warriors
The Warriors are interesting. They lost Kevin Durant in free agency, and Klay Thompson is currently injured and is most likely out for the season. However, they did manage to snag D'Angelo Russell from the Booklyn Nets. Although D'Angleo Russell is a good addition, he doesn't solve their newfound defensive problems. Yes, they have scoring, however they are going to let up a lot of points; which is going to lead to losses.

**Pros**
* Scoring
* Shooting

**Cons**
* Horrible Defense
* Curry reliant
* No Depth
* Lacking Bigs

## Philidelphia 76ers
The 76ers have always been a few peices from becoming a true title contender. Throughout the past 2 or so years they've been hovering a little above average. However, this season with the resigning of Tobias Harris, Ben Simmons, and the additions of Al Horford and Josh Richardson; they have a serious team. However, the question that will always come up is: "Can Joel Embiid stay healthy?" Joel Embiid is their best player however, he's extremely injury prone, and that can be a liability come playoff time.

**Pros**
* Strong starting 5
* Great Defense
* Very tall which can be a problem for some teams

**Cons** 
* Not much shooting
* Very top heavy
* Depth is questionable 

## Milwaukee Bucks
The Bucks suffered a little over the offseason by losing Malcolm Brogdon. He was their elite floor spacer and 3pt shooter. However they were able to somewhat replace him with Kyle Korver and Wesley Matthews. It's obvious what the Bucks are trying to do. They are trying to surround Giannis with as much shooting as possible, and did they do it? Yes. Although, with the loss of Macolm Brogdon, this puts more weight on Kris Middleton to produce the same or better all star numbers he showed last year. I'm not reall worried about Giannis because we all know he's going to get his 30pts, 11reb, and 8ast nightly.

**Pros**
* Giannis
* 3pt shooting
* Defense 

**Cons**
* Bench
